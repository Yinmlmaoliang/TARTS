    # --- Online Prototype Update Parameters ---

    # Momentum coefficient for exponential moving average [0.0-1.0]
    # Higher values = slower adaptation (0.9 means 90% old + 10% new)

    # --- Optimal Prototype Update Node Selection Parameters ---
    #
    # These parameters control the intelligent selection of prototype update nodes
    # for footprint projection, ensuring good visibility and projection quality.

    # Minimum observation distance (meters)
    # The minimum distance from footprint center to prototype update node.
    # Ensures footprint is within camera field of view (1m+ recommended).
    min_observation_distance: 1.0

    # High-quality projection threshold [0.0-1.0]
    # Ratio of footprint points that must project validly into image.
    # First pass: only nodes with ≥80% valid projection are considered.
    high_quality_projection_threshold: 0.8

    # High-quality depth threshold [0.0-1.0]
    # Ratio of footprint points that must be in front of camera (positive depth).
    # First pass: only nodes with ≥90% valid depth are considered.
    high_quality_depth_threshold: 0.9

    # Fallback projection threshold [0.0-1.0]
    # If no high-quality nodes found, lower threshold to 50% in second pass.
    # Prevents update failure when camera viewing conditions are suboptimal.
    fallback_projection_threshold: 0.5

    # Fallback depth threshold [0.0-1.0]
    # If no high-quality nodes found, lower depth threshold to 70% in second pass.
    fallback_depth_threshold: 0.7

    # Perfect projection threshold [0.0-1.0]
    # Early stopping: if node has ≥95% valid projection, stop searching.
    # Improves efficiency by avoiding unnecessary candidate evaluation.
